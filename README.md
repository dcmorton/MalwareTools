-----------
vtsubmit.py

Submits malware files to VirusTotal using the Version 1.0 of the VirusTotal Public API and saves results to a MySQL database.

See https://www.virustotal.com/documentation/public-api/v1/ for more VT API info.

Usage instructions:
	1) Create VirusTotal account, get your Public API key
	2) Add your API key and MySQL connection info to the relevant parts of vtsumbit.py
	3) Create the tables in the database by calling: python vtsubmit.py --init
	4) Start adding files by running: python vtsubmit.py -v -f <filename>
	
If a sample already exists in the database, use the "-o" option to resumbit it to retrive updated results from VirusTotal.

This script is based of Michael Ligh's avsubmit.py script from the Malware Analyst's Cookbook. The original script is available here: http://code.google.com/p/malwarecookbook/
